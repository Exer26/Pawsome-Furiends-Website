Sign up and Choose a Plan:
Once you've decided on a web hosting provider, visit their website and sign up for an account. Select a hosting plan that aligns with your website's needs, considering factors like storage, bandwidth, and additional features.

Domain Registration:
If you haven't already registered a domain for your website, most web hosting providers offer domain registration services. You can register a new domain or transfer an existing one to the hosting provider.

Upload Your Website Files:
After setting up your hosting account, you'll receive the necessary credentials to access your hosting control panel. Use an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client to upload your website files to the server. Make sure to place your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files in the appropriate directories.

Configure DNS Settings:
To connect your domain with your hosting provider, you'll need to update the DNS (Domain Name System) settings. Refer to your hosting provider's documentation for specific instructions on how to configure the DNS settings.

Test and Launch:
Once your website files are uploaded and the DNS settings are configured, perform thorough testing to ensure everything is working as expected. Check for any broken links, responsiveness issues, or functionality errors. Once you're satisfied with the results, it's time to launch your website for the world to see.
